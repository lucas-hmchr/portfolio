                <p>I am passionate about coding because it combines analytical thinking with creativity. I enjoy
                    breaking down complex problems into clear solutions and turning ideas into real, working
                    applications. Coding challenges me to stay persistent, to keep learning, and to continuously
                    improve. I also value collaboration â€” sharing knowledge, working with others, and building something
                    greater together. For me, coding is not just about writing code, but about solving problems and
                    creating meaningful solutions.
